<h4>BRAZIL</h4>
<p>The series on aquaculture values prior to 2006 have been extensively revised downwards in accordance with 2006 data reported by national authorities.<p></p>Production data of reference years 2008-2012 were downwards adjusted for most of the farmed species by the national data reporting office when data for 2013 were reported.<p></p>Previously reported data for 2013 and estimates by FAO for 2014-2018 were revised by using 2013-2018 data reported by Brazilian fisheries authority together with 2019 data. Brazilian reporting office indicated IBGE as source of all 2013-2019 data. The revision resulted in an overall lower production level in the affected reference years, due largely to the downwards revised Nile tilapia production.<p></p>Data of small production of mariculture of finfish and aquatic algae cultivation are not available.</p>

<div id="CHINA">
<h4>CHINA</h4>
<p>For statistical purposes, the data for China do not include Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR), Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) and Taiwan Province of China.<p></p>Along with the national production quantity data report for 2017 reference year, Chinese authority also reported the revisions of previously reported data based on the result of the Third National Agriculture Census, including (a) adjusted data for 2016 with both upwards and downwards changes depending the species or species group, and (b) downwards adjusted data for 2012-2015 at total production level but separated only between freshwater aquaculture and salt water aquaculture. The species item level data for 2012-2015 in FAO data system were revised downwards accordingly based their respective proportions in the historical data reported to FAO. Data for 2009-2011 were further adjusted by FAO to respect the historical trend in annual variation of total aquaculture production in the country.<p></p>Aquaculture data for 1997-2006 were substantially revised by FAO according to the report by the Chinese authorities of about 14 percent reduction of 2006 production figures at aggregated level, based on the Second National Agriculture Census conducted in 2007 for the reference year 2006 including fishery and aquaculture.<p></p>Data for 2003-2008 were provided for many new species items, resulting in reductions in the amount of production attributed to the aggregated species items “Freshwater fishes nei”, “Marine fishes nei”, “Aquatic plants nei”, “Marine molluscs nei” and “Marine crabs nei”.<p></p>Data for several individually reported species prior to this issue require further review for revision or desegregation. The production figures previously identified as Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) include a major portion consisting of other scallop species, while the data for Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus). from freshwater include significant portion of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). White amur bream (Parabramis pekinensis) production also include noteworthy portion of Chinese blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala). The Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) data also include remarkable portion of European eel (Anguilla anguilla).<p></p>The 1984–1995 aquaculture data for “Pacific cupped oyster” (Crassostrea gigas), “Blood cockle” (Anadara granosa), “Japanese carpet shell” (Ruditapes philippinarum) and “Marine molluscs nei” have been revised. Formerly these data were expressed nationally in meat or shelled weight basis; in this publication, they have been converted to their live weight equivalents by using respectively the conversion factors of 6.11, 1.35, 2.13 and 2.13 officially provided by the national reporting office.<p></p>The 1984–2008 data for aquatic plants, expressed nationally on a dry-weight basis, have been converted by FAO to their wet-weight equivalents by using the conversion factor 5 for “Japanese kelp” (Laminaria japonica) and 10 for “Laver (Nori)” (Porphyra tenera) and “Aquatic plants nei”.<p></p>The 2000-2002 aquaculture production data for “Oriental river prawn” (Macrobrachium nipponense) have been included based on published reports.  The figures for 2003-2008 have been provided by the national reporting office.<p></p>Data for “Turbot” for 2003-2017 were subtracted from “Lefteye flounders nei” as FAO estimates.<p></p>Data for “Pearl oyster shells nei” refer to production of pearls. Data for “Triangle sail mussel” Hyriopsis cumingii for 2007-2008 were subtracted from “aquatic invertebrates nei” and they refer to production of freshwater pearls.<p></p>First-sale value of aquaculture production has been re-estimated for all farmed species for 2009-2015, except Japanese kelp and Nori nei for 1984-2015.<p></p>Data of Japanese kelp (Laminaria japonica) time series were adjusted by FAO by substituting previously used factor of “5.00” with the new factor of “6.76” for converting reported data in dry weight to the live weight equivalent.</p>
